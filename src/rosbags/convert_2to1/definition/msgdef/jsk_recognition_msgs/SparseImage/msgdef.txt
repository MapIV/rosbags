uint32 width
uint32 height

# each uint8 or uint16 contains position of white pixel expressed like: "(x << 8 or 16) ^ y"
# if max(width, height) > 256(=2^8) use data32 array, else use data16 array.
uint16[] data16

# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data 
# in a particular coordinate frame.
# 
# sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID 
uint32 seq
#Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as:
# * stamp.sec: seconds (stamp_secs) since epoch (in Python the variable is called 'secs')
# * stamp.nsec: nanoseconds since stamp_secs (in Python the variable is called 'nsecs')
# time-handling sugar is provided by the client library
time stamp
