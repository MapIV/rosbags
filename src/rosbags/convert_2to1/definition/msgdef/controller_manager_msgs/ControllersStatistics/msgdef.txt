# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data 
# in a particular coordinate frame.
# 
# sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID 
uint32 seq
#Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as:
# * stamp.sec: seconds (stamp_secs) since epoch (in Python the variable is called 'secs')
# * stamp.nsec: nanoseconds since stamp_secs (in Python the variable is called 'nsecs')
# time-handling sugar is provided by the client library
time stamp
#Frame this data is associated with
string frame_id

# This message contains the state of one realtime controller
# that was spawned in the controller manager

# the name of the controller
string name

# the type of the controller
string type

# the time at which these controller statistics were measured
time timestamp

# bool that indicates if the controller is currently
# in a running or a stopped state
bool running

# the maximum time the update loop of the controller ever needed to complete
duration max_time

# the average time the update loop of the controller needs to complete.
# the average is computed in a sliding time window.
duration mean_time

# the variance on the time the update loop of the controller needs to complete.
# the variance applies to a sliding time window.
