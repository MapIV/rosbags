# This is a message to hold data from an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
#
# Accelerations should be in m/s^2 (not in g's), and rotational velocity should be in rad/sec
#
# If the covariance of the measurement is known, it should be filled in (if all you know is the 
# variance of each measurement, e.g. from the datasheet, just put those along the diagonal)
# A covariance matrix of all zeros will be interpreted as "covariance unknown", and to use the
# data a covariance will have to be assumed or gotten from some other source
#
# If you have no estimate for one of the data elements (e.g. your IMU doesn't produce an orientation 
# estimate), please set element 0 of the associated covariance matrix to -1
# If you are interpreting this message, please check for a value of -1 in the first element of each 
# covariance matrix, and disregard the associated estimate.

MSG: geometry_msgs/Vector3
# This represents a vector in free space. 
# It is only meant to represent a direction. Therefore, it does not
# make sense to apply a translation to it (e.g., when applying a 
# generic rigid transformation to a Vector3, tf2 will only apply the
# rotation). If you want your data to be translatable too, use the
# geometry_msgs/Point message instead.
