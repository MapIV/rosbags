MSG: std_msgs/Header
# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data 
# in a particular coordinate frame.
# 
# sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID 
uint32 seq
#Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as:
# * stamp.sec: seconds (stamp_secs) since epoch (in Python the variable is called 'secs')
# * stamp.nsec: nanoseconds since stamp_secs (in Python the variable is called 'nsecs')
# time-handling sugar is provided by the client library
time stamp

# This represents lanes that are next to each other.
# This relation object is only made if the lane change is available.

uint8 Left = 1

# Id of refering lane
int32 lane_id

# Id of lane that is next to the refering lane. 
int32 next_lane_id

# Represents blinker that must be lit when doing this lane change.
# value of "blinker" must be one of "Blinker Type"
# e.g. if next_lane_id is left of lane_id, then blinker = LEFT
