std_msgs/Header header
Signal[] signals  # A list of traffic signals

================================================================================
MSG: std_msgs/Header
# Standard metadata for higher-level stamped data types.
# This is generally used to communicate timestamped data 
# in a particular coordinate frame.
# 
# sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID 
uint32 seq
#Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as:
# * stamp.sec: seconds (stamp_secs) since epoch (in Python the variable is called 'secs')
# * stamp.nsec: nanoseconds since stamp_secs (in Python the variable is called 'nsecs')
# time-handling sugar is provided by the client library
time stamp
#Frame this data is associated with
string frame_id

MSG: lgsvl_msgs/Signal
std_msgs/Header header
uint32 id  # The numeric ID of the detected signal
string label  # green, yellow, red
float32 score  # The confidence score of the detected signal in the range [0-1]
BoundingBox3D bbox  # A 3D bounding box

================================================================================
MSG: lgsvl_msgs/BoundingBox3D
geometry_msgs/Pose position  # 3D position and orientation of the bounding box center in Lidar space, in meters
geometry_msgs/Vector3 size  # Size of the bounding box, in meters

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Pose
# A representation of pose in free space, composed of position and orientation. 
Point position
Quaternion orientation

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Point
# This contains the position of a point in free space

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Quaternion
# This represents an orientation in free space in quaternion form.

================================================================================
MSG: geometry_msgs/Vector3
# This represents a vector in free space. 
# It is only meant to represent a direction. Therefore, it does not
# make sense to apply a translation to it (e.g., when applying a 
# generic rigid transformation to a Vector3, tf2 will only apply the
# rotation). If you want your data to be translatable too, use the
# geometry_msgs/Point message instead.
